# Title: Update GitHub Actions Workflow for Documentation Generation

## WHAT
- Enhanced the GitHub Actions workflow for generating documentation by:
  - Checking out the contributor's branch instead of the read-only merge ref.
  - Modifying dependency installation to exclude audit and funding.
  - Improving the handling of documentation previews and commit logic.

## WHY
- To ensure that the workflow correctly references the contributor's branch, allowing for accurate documentation generation.
- To streamline dependency installation, reducing unnecessary checks.
- To improve the robustness of the preview handling and ensure meaningful output even when no preview is available.

## HOW
- Key files and logic:
  - Updated `.github/workflows/alvin-docs.yml` to:
    - Use `actions/checkout@v4` with parameters to check out the correct branch.
    - Install dependencies with `npm i --no-audit --no-fund`.
    - Enhance the logic for generating and committing documentation.
    - Improve the preview output handling to provide a default message when no preview file is found.
