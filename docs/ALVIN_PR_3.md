# PR Documentation: feat: tweak homepage message to v2

## What Changed
- Updated the homepage message in `app/index.js` to reflect version 2.

## Why
- To enhance user experience by providing updated information that aligns with the latest version of the application.

## How to Validate
1. Pull the latest changes from the branch.
2. Start the application locally.
3. Navigate to the homepage and verify that the message displays the new version 2 text.

## Risk/Rollback
- **Risk**: Minimal risk as the change is limited to a text update.
- **Rollback**: If issues arise, revert to the previous version of `app/index.js` to restore the old homepage message.
